Feature: Check for cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability using arachni against gruyere
Background:
  Given "arachni" is installed

Scenario: Do a full XSS

  When I launch an "archani" attack with:
  """
  arachni --check=XSS --scope-page-limit=1 http://172.17.0.2:80008/login
  """
  Then the output should contain "0 issues were detected"
